// Conditional Logic

var kidHeight = 50;
var minHeight = 48;


// if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
// If the kid is over 48 inches in height
if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    // code performed if the condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}else{
    //code only performed if condition is false
    console.log("Sorry you got some growing to do first");
}


//this changes the css of your body tag to be green
document.querySelector("body").style.backgroundColor= "#00FF00";
