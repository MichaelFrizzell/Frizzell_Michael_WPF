//Most students and tandem skydives open their parachutes at 5000'' +
//'. Licensed and more experienced jumpers will open usually between 2000' and 3500'.' +
//' Altitude is safety and time, so you start opening higher for time, and as you become more experienced, ' +
//'many decide to open a little lower.
//The type of parachute you are flying have a great influence on opening altitude.
//    High performance parachutes descend at very high speeds, s
//o higher opening altitudes make more sense as they give the
//pilot more time to set up for landing and deal with possible malfunctions.
//
//2000' is generally accepted as the lowest opening altitude for safety reasons.
